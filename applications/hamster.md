## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Hamster is a decentralized computing network based on the underlying chain. It aims to provide users with cost-effective computing servers. It is a decentralized platform for leasing computing resources that can be performed to rent idle computing resources

Currently there are many cloud computing service vendors providing cloud computing services, but currently with the expansion of services, the price of cloud computing services is gradually stabilized and high, and most of the cloud computing services are purchased on an annual basis, which causes great waste for current users who may use them for a short period of time, while the world's hardware capacity is gradually increasing today, and people have more and more idle computer products on hand. The goal of our product is to utilize the current idle computing resources in people's hands in a decentralized way, so that users who need it can use computing services in a cost-effective way.

Our team aims to build a complete platform for leasing idle computing resources. The decentralized computing resource leasing function is realized by using substrate framework pallet, which can be leased and traded on the chain, and the link and use of computing resources can be done through the p2p network protocol under the chain after signing the lease agreement on the chain.

### Project Details

Hamster is composed of Hamster nodes, Hamster resource providers, Hamster clients, Hamster gateways, and Hamster front-end pages.

- Hamster Node: is a custom node built on Substrate 3.0.
  - pallet_provider: performs resource provider registration and provider resource information storage, and provides a computational marketplace
  - pallet_resource-order: performs resource lease order functions and lease agreement execution
  - pallet_gateway: The gateway mainly has the following functions: gateway registration, gateway heartbeat detection, gateway status reset, gateway drop penalty, and receive rewards. The main role is to add the gateway as an important player in the shared computing platform
- Hamster Gateway: p2p gateway with public IP, used to link information between resource provider and resource user, built with libp2p component, is the cornerstone of the leased resource availability, can register itself to Hamster Node
- Hamster Provider: can provide compute resources and register them with Hamster Node. Compute resources are provided using both vm virtual machine technology and docker technology. Currently vm virtual machine technology is used to better protect user privacy
- Hamster Client: After purchasing in the front end marketplace, users can view their purchased compute resources through the client and link to them.
- Hamster Front End: Hamster Dapp, which allows users to purchase compute resources that have already been provided, and pay a certain Token to purchase a certain amount of time to use the compute resources. We can pay by the hour for more flexible use.

###### Anti-malicious attacks

- How do you ensure the system isnâ€™t exploited and users actually fulfill the agreement?

  When the agreement is reached, the provider is required to complete the creation of the virtual machine, notify the blockchain of the completion of the order agreement, and request a heartbeat per epoch, which includes the number of cpu cores and memory size, for the blockchain to verify that it is working and providing valid resources. The potential threat is a nefarious provider forging heartbeats to trick the network into providing a valid service that actually provides less than the promised resources or even none at all. Since we have thought long and hard about this, and we do not currently have a cryptographic or better design to accomplish such a solution, we have adopted the idea of an arbitration model to prevent malicious attacks.

  ![](https://gitee.com/ltyuanmu/drawing-bed/raw/master/202201241409500.jpg)

  1. when the user finds a problem with the resource and the information configured at the time of purchase does not match, submits a validation request and requests arbitration. in order to ensure that there is no malicious validation, the submission of the request will have a certain cost pledge.
  2. the arbitration group is subject to the validation request, currently designed to arbitrate the group for the current chain of validators. because he is the block validator, will promote the role of the current ecology. It is a trusted team
  3. the arbitration group to link the computing resources, after entering the link for linux least privilege account, to query the virtual machine specifications
  4. arbitration break to verify and report the vote
  5. according to the voting results for incentives and penalties, to achieve the purpose of malicious evil.

  We will follow up with cryptography or a better algorithmic model to replace the arbitration model. This will be a major topic of our subsequent research.

- What are other potential attack vectors and how are you going to address them?

  - Virtual machine p2p connection security:

    The connection port of the virtual machine is exposed to the p2p network and is vulnerable to security attacks from the p2p network. When provier creates a virtual machine, it will use the public key of the purchasing user and inject it into the virtual machine. The password will be changed to a random password to ensure that no one can access it, and disable remote login by password. This protects the login security of the virtual machine.

  - Host network security:

    Mainly facing `Escape Exploit` . The 'Escape Exploit' problem is a persistent network security attack and needs to be solved by updating the corresponding software in time. We will iterate on the provider virtualization technology in the future.

### Ecosystem Fit

Our project is a distributed shared computing platform. Through the shared computing platform, our target customers are user groups with idle resource machines and some users who want to use cost-effective resources, they can be developers, designers, etc., and can deploy their inspirations that they want to share to our shared computing network to share out. The follow-up vision is to build an ecosystem of shared services on the shared platform network

## Future Plans

Our long-term vision is to provide distributed shared computing power. When the milestone is completed, we will expand the upper level ecology based on resources, where more web services can be built and constructed into a new service ecosystem in the Hamster network. Perhaps it can become a meta-universe service cornerstone possibility.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

So far, we are self-funded development. However, for our long-term vision, we will try to get support from investment institutions.
